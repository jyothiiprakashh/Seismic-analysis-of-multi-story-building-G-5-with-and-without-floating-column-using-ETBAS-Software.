# Seismic-analysis-of-multi-story-building-G-5-with-and-without-floating-column-using-ETBAS-Software.
In this project we took 3 models of floating column, those are center floating column, edge floating column and corner floating column.
With those models we compared the analysis result of a building with normal column and a building with edge and centered floating column which was given by the ETABS software. 
We compared the buildings with static and dynamic loads. instead of static we took load combinations and whereas when coming to dynamic loading we mainly focussed on earthquake load
and the results of each and everything was shown in terms of tables and graphs to understand easily.

Coming to the conclusion we stated that:

-> From the above models, Interior placement of a floating column at the 4th story reduces maximum story displacement by 1.96% compared to an edge floating 
column placed from the 1st story to top of the building.
-> Compared to a building without floating columns, story shear decreases by up to 3.26% in a building with an edge floating column, while it increases by 0.01% in 
a building with an internal floating column.
-> Floating columns are primarily designed to carry vertical loads, such as gravity (dead and live loads), but they are not well-suited to resist lateral forces induced 
by wind or earthquakes. The floating column method will be adopted unless the building has specific space requirements.
